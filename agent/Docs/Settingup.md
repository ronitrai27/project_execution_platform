The actual application entry point is app/main.py. This is where the FastAPI instance (app = FastAPI(...)) is created and where your routes are included.

server.py: This is a convenience script for local development. It loads your .env file and starts uvicorn. It points to app.main:app, which confirms that the real app lives in app/main.py.
app/main.py: This is the core of your server. In a production environment (like Docker/Cloud Run), you should run this directly.
